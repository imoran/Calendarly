# Calendarly

Calendarly is an app that allows users to create appointments.

It uses Vanilla JavaScript to structure and design the app, while the CSS does the styling.

The Splash page is responsive and renders the pictures through animations.

The Calendar is built without the use of any external libraries and handles time manipulation with the sole use of the JavaScript Date() instance.


The app was built with the intention of adding a backend for a business to input their available appointments for specific services and for the customer to pick from those dates using this scheduling system.


Future implementations include email/text confirmation, and the ability for users to cancel and reschedule appointments.
